My EFI Folder for my Sony VAIO SVS1512X9E/SVS1512X9EB. Hope you enjoy it :)

Notes: Serial&Other SMBIOS things are removed.

Catalina and High Sierra are most stable for performance.

Big Sur has a ton of input lag

Monterey is not installable due to Ivy Bridge (Intel HD 4000) GPU drivers been dropped by Apple.
